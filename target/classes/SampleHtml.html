        <li>Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explain that it's
            very important that you get away as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the White
            House-(202) 456-1414-to have a word on your behalf with the guys at
            NASA.</li>
        <li>If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin
            (ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-9051). They don't have any
            friends there either (at least, none to speak of), but they do seem to have a
            little influence, so you may as well try.</li>
        <li>If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number is
            011-39-6-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible.</li>
        <li>If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explain
            that it's vitally important you get away before your phone bill arrives.</li>

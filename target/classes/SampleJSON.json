  "Step one": "Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explain that it's very important that you get away as soon as possible.",
  "Step two": "If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the White House-(202) 456-1414-to have a word on your behalf with the guys at NASA.",
  "Step three": "If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin (ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-9051). They don't have any friends there either (at least, none to speak of), but they do seem to have a\n  little influence, so you may as well try.",
  "Step four": "If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number is 011-39-6-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible.",
  "Step five": "If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explain that it's vitally important you get away before your phone bill arrives."

    <h1>How to Leave the Planet</h1>
    <p>
        1. Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explain that it's
        very important that you get away as soon as possible.<br>
        2. If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the White
        House-(202) 456-1414-to have a word on your behalf with the guys at
        NASA.<br>
        3. If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin
        (ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-9051). They don't have any
        friends there either (at least, none to speak of), but they do seem to have a
        little influence, so you may as well try.<br>
        4. If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number is
        011-39-6-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible.<br>
        5. If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explain
        that it's vitally important you get away before your phone bill arrives.</p>
